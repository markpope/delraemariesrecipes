# Delrae Marie's Recipes

This is part of learning journey that started with a php app to track family recipes. It started as a simple website running on a SPARC server in my closet and has been migrated to new tech stacks as I've evaluted new technologies.

In 2000 3COM introduced a countertop internet appliance [Ergo Audery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3Com_Audrey) It was Palm Pilot on steroids, color touch-stylus display, browser capability, a radial knob for selecting favorite web sites, okay speaker, and several of Palm OS standard apps.

The first version of Delrae Marie's Recipes was developed to display well on Audery using Php and Apache. The following technologies have shared our recipes since the then

    1. LAMP Stack
    2. Tomcat / JSP / Servlets
    3. JBoss / Javascript / Hibernate / EJBs
    4. Ruby on Rails
    5. Grails
    6. Google App Engine
    7. Google Compute Engine
    8. App Sheets
    9. Flutter + Firebase
    10. Amazon Honeycode

I added this readme.md file to explain why I still keep 10+ year old, unmaintained, undeployable source code around. The memories of preparing those recipes for our family are far more important than emerging tech that came and went.
